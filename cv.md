**I became interested in IT because I like to create something new and see the result of my work. The program provided great opportunities for personal development and career growth. To begin with, I decided to front-end development - it attracted me with a variety of tasks and tools, as well as extensive communities. I don't stop at the achievement, I continue to study tools for the front-end, as well as other languages and technologies. At the moment I am studying as a "Web developer" at SkyPro University.**
